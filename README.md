# PreventEruptions
This project is in collaboration with Alexis Courboin.

How to prevent eruptions ? 
This project focuses on the modellisation of a seismometer and highlights the link between earthquakes and eruptions.
-> In this project we created a seismometer in order to understand how it works.
We compare it to a theorical model to see if a seismometer is an appropriate way to prevent eruptions.
